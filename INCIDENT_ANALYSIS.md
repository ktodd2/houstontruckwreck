# Houston Truck Wreck - Incident Detection Analysis

## Issue Summary
Your app missed detecting this specific incident from TranStar:
**IH-69 Eastex Northbound After FM-1960 | Heavy Truck, Stall | Right Shoulder | Verified at 3:16 PM**

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Primary Issue: Dynamic Content Loading**
- TranStar's website uses JavaScript to load incident data dynamically
- Your current scraper uses BeautifulSoup which only parses static HTML
- The incident data is loaded after the initial page load via AJAX/JavaScript

### 2. **Secondary Issues Identified:**

#### A. URL Target Problem
- Current URL: `https://traffic.houstontranstar.org/roadclosures/#all`
- This loads a page with tabs, but the actual data is in separate sections
- The "Stalls" tab contains the missed incident

#### B. Stalls Setting
- Your app has a setting to include/exclude stalls
- If disabled, heavy truck stalls won't trigger alerts
- This could be why the incident was missed

#### C. Pattern Matching
- The current regex patterns may not catch all variations
- Need to ensure "Heavy Truck, Stall" format is detected

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved Scraper (improved_scraper.py)**
- Attempts to use API endpoints first
- Enhanced pattern matching for "Heavy Truck" incidents
- Better handling of TranStar's data format
- Improved logging for debugging

### 2. **Selenium Scraper (selenium_scraper.py)**
- Uses browser automation to handle JavaScript content
- Clicks on different tabs (Stalls, Freeway Incidents)
- Waits for dynamic content to load
- More reliable for modern web applications

### 3. **Test Script (test_incident_detection.py)**
- Tests specific incident patterns
- Checks current settings
- Validates pattern matching logic

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. **Check Stalls Setting**
```bash
cd houstontruckwreck-main
python -c "from models import Database, Settings; db = Database(); print('Include stalls:', Settings.get_include_stalls(db))"
```

### 2. **Enable Stalls if Disabled**
- Log into your admin panel
- Go to Settings
- Enable "Include Stalls" option

### 3. **Test Current Detection**
```bash
cd houstontruckwreck-main
```

### 4. **Update Scraper**
âœ… **COMPLETED**: The improved scraper is now active as the main scraper.
- Old scraper backed up as `scraper_old.py`
- Improved scraper functionality now in `scraper.py`
- All imports updated to use the enhanced version

## Long-term Recommendations

### 1. **Use Selenium for Reliability**
- Install Chrome and ChromeDriver
- Use selenium_scraper.py for production
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content properly

### 2. **Add Monitoring**
- Log all incidents found vs. incidents processed
- Add alerts when scraping fails
- Monitor for pattern changes on TranStar

### 3. **Enhance Pattern Matching**
- Add more truck-related keywords
- Improve location parsing for Houston highways
- Handle different time formats

### 4. **API Alternative**
- Check if TranStar offers an official API
- Consider using Houston's Open Data portal
- Implement fallback data sources

## Technical Details

### Why the Incident Was Missed

1. **JavaScript Loading**: The incident data loads after page load
2. **Tab Structure**: Data is in "Stalls" tab, not main view
3. **Format Variation**: "Heavy Truck, Stall" format may not match patterns
4. **Settings**: Stalls might be disabled in configuration

### Pattern Matching Improvements

The improved scraper now detects:
- "Heavy Truck" (exact phrase)
- "Heavy truck stall" patterns
- IH-69, Eastex highway indicators
- Various truck-related keywords

### Location Parsing Enhancements

- Converts "Northbound After FM-1960" to "NB @ FM-1960"
- Standardizes highway names (IH-69, I-69, etc.)
- Handles TranStar's specific formatting

## Testing the Fix

Run this command to test if the specific incident would now be detected:

```bash
cd houstontruckwreck-main
python -c "
from scraper import TranStarScraper
incident = 'IH-69 Eastex Northbound After FM-1960 Heavy Truck, Stall Right Shoulder Verified at 3:16 PM'
scraper = TranStarScraper()
print('Would detect:', scraper.is_relevant_incident(incident))
"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Check and enable stalls setting
2. **Short-term**: Deploy improved scraper
3. **Long-term**: Implement Selenium-based solution
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor and refine detection patterns
